# Job Interview Simulator Web Application

This web application is a Job Interview Simulator that helps users practice their interview skills. Users can enter a job title and the AI-powered system will generate relevant interview questions. Users can then respond to these questions and receive feedback on their responses, as well as a final decision on whether they would be accepted for the job.

### Usage

- Enter a job title, and the app will generate 5 interview questions for the role.
- Respond to each question, and the app will evaluate your response and provide feedback.
- After answering all the questions, the app will provide a final decision on your performance.

## Architecture

The application is built using the Flask web framework and is powered by OpenAI's GPT-3.5 API. It has the following primary components:

1. **Flask**: A lightweight web framework used to develop the web application.
2. **SQLAlchemy**: A SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) system that gives application developers the full power and flexibility of SQL.
3. **OpenAI API**: The GPT-3.5 API is used to generate interview questions, evaluate responses, and provide feedback to the user.
4. **Flask-Login**: A Flask extension that handles user authentication and management.
5. **Flask-WTF**: A Flask extension for handling forms.
6. **Flask-Bcrypt**: A Flask extension for hashing passwords.
7. **Flask-SQLAlchemy**: A Flask extension that provides a simple interface for using SQLAlchemy with Flask.

## Notes for marker
- Execute the unit test (unit_test.py) before running the app.
- When the html validator is run on the chat_logs.html, there are some errors associated with the Jinja2 code, this is because the HTML validator can only validate plain HTML. It cannot parse or understand server-side templating languages like Jinja2.
- Therefore to test the html it's necessary to render the html in a browser and test the rendered html instead of the chat_logs.html as when they are rendered the Jinja2 templating engine will process all of the Jinja code and replace them with the appropriate HTML content.

## Setup

Follow the instructions below to setup a virtual environment and run the application.

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/uwaysm/Job-Interview-Simulator
cd Job-Interview-Simulator
```

2. Create a virtual environment:
```
python -m venv env
```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
- On Windows:
```
.\env\Scripts\activate
```

- On Unix or MacOS:
```
source env/bin/activate
```
4. Install the necessary Python packages:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
5. Set your OpenAI API key in the `.env` file in the variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`

6. Run the application:
```
python3 app.py
```

6. Open a web browser and enter the following URL to access the application:

`http://127.0.0.1:5000/`

# Python-Unittest Unit Tests
The unit tests for the Job Interview Simulator web application cover the following features:

## 1. User Registration, Login, and Logout

- Test successful user registration with a unique username and password.
- Test unsuccessful user registration with an existing username.
- Test successful user login and logout.
- Test unsuccessful user login with the wrong password.
- Test unsuccessful user login with a nonexistent username.

## 2. Job Title Validation

- Test the validation of real job titles.
- Test the validation of job titles with no input.

## 3. Interview Question Generation

- Test successful interview question generation based on a job title.
- Test unsuccessful interview question generation with no input.

## 4. Response Evaluation

- Test successful evaluation of user responses with scores and feedback.
- Test unsuccessful evaluation of user responses with no input.

## 5. Final Decision Making

- Test the final decision-making process based on user responses.
- Test the final decision-making process with no input.

## 6. Session Handling
- Tests whether a session can be successfully added to the database. 
- Compares the chat history recorded in the database with the input responses, checking if they are of the same length and contain the same values.

## 7. Chat Logs Access
- Tests whether an authenticated user can successfully access the chat logs.
- Checks if the response status code is 200, indicating successful access.
- Tests the behavior when an unauthenticated user tries to access the chat logs page
- Checks if the response status code is not equal to 400, indicating that an unauthorized request has not been made.

You can find the corresponding test methods in the `TestFlaskApp` class in the `unit_tests.py` file.

## How to run the unit tests

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have completed the steps to set up and run the web application locally. Additionally, ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

- unittest

## Step 1: Run the tests

Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project directory, and run the following command to execute the unit tests:

```bash
python -m unittest unit_tests.py
```

## Selenium Unit Tests

In our application, we use Selenium for end-to-end testing. Selenium is a powerful tool for controlling web browsers through programs and automating browser tasks. It provides a way to test interactions that require complex user behaviors or sequences of events, and it can be used to simulate real user interactions with your web application.

### Running Selenium Tests

Before running the tests, ensure that you have the Selenium WebDriver installed and configured also ensure that the app is running through the command `python3 app.py`. You will also need to have the specific WebDriver for the browser you wish to use (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).

To run the tests, use the following command:

```shell
python -m unittest selenium_unittest.py
```
